### Pick your fighter and try your luck in Mortal Kombat!
Insert a coin and press [start](https://sob96.github.io/MortalKombat/).

There are 2 main components: `startScreen` and `fightScreen`.  `startScreen` provides rendering and selection of characters. `fightScreen` includes 
`gameplay` (fight process), `players` (fighters rendering  on arena), `logGeneration` (creating of logs during fighting)
and `utils` (several support functions). 

In this project I mastered:
- JS functions, classes and objects
- work with DOM
- JS modules
- promises, async/await
- object destructuring, spread syntax
- work with forms

All components are in the MortalKombat folder.

You can run this project locally just do:

- clone a main branch with *git clone* [https://github.com/Sob96/MortalKombat.git](https://github.com/Sob96/MortalKombat.git) or fork it and then clone from your forked repo
- open *index.html* with Live Server.
